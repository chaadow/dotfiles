" Zip Right
"
" Moves the character under the cursor to the end of the line.  Handy when you
" have something like:
"
"     foo
"
" And you want to wrap it in a method call, so you type:
"
"     println()foo
"
" Once you hit escape your cursor is on the closing paren, so you can 'zip' it
" over to the right with this mapping.
"
" This should preserve your last yank/delete as well.
